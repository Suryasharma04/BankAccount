# BankAccount

(NOTE: This software was created with my classmates Amirzhan Skakov, Cole Prochilo, and Betty Gebru for our software engineering course, guided by Professor Doug Turnbull.)

It's a program for a bank that keeps track of all accounts. It has a simple interface like an ATM where users can confirm their password, check their balance, withdraw money, deposit money, transfer money between their accounts, and see their transaction history. 

It also connects to software used by bank tellers. They can do everything the ATM can, plus they can open new accounts and close accounts. 

The system also connects to administrative software. Administrators can check how much money is in the bank overall, ask for a report on any accounts that seem suspicious, and freeze or unfreeze accounts. When an account is frozen, no one can use it until an administrator unfreezes it.

The bank has two kinds of accounts: savings and checking. Customers can have one or both kinds. Savings accounts earn interest every day at midnight, but there's a limit to how much money you can take out each day. Checking accounts don't earn interest or have withdrawal limits. And no account can be overdrawn, meaning you can't take out more money than you have in your account.
